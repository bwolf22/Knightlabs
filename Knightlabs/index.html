<p style="color: white;">Derek Jeter's 20-year career was a true fairy tale. Growing up a Yankee fan in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the All-Star shortstop's dream became reality when he was selected sixth overall to the esteemed franchise in 1992. Jeter made his MLB debut in 1995 and changed the franchise forever in 1996 when he earned the job as the starting shortstop and won the American League Rookie of the Year. The Captain would win five World Series alongside 14 All-Star selections, five Golde Gloves, and five Silver Slugger Awards.

<p style="color: white;">Jeter was mesmerizing, whether it was the jump throw, the flip play, or his walk-off single to end his final game at Yankee Stadium. Jeters served as a true inspiration for kids, seeing everyone wear two on their backs and try to make the ridiculous plays he was able to make. Jeterâ€™s name and number hang proudly in Cooperstown, New York, and Monument Park. Derek Jeter was a blessing to the game of baseball.
